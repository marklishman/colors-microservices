## Mutable State

In Reactor and RxJava, you declare logic through operators, and, at runtime, a reactive 
pipeline is formed where data is processed sequentially, in distinct stages. A key benefit 
of this is that it frees applications from having to protect mutable state because 
application code within that pipeline is never invoked concurrently.
